# adclick-simulator

This is an Ad-click Auction Simulator that takes multiple bidding policies and emulate running 2nd price auction for sponsored search advertisement placing similar to Google's Ad-click system.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This software was tested with Python 3.6 running on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04.

#### Python

Anaconda is an easy way to get a working python.
Get it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

The initial version of the simulator is tested on 64-bit python 3.6 as follows:

```
Python 3.6.1 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, May 23 2017, 14:21:39) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

#### Packages

The packages required by the simulator are:

- numpy: used for pseudorandom number generator and many useful functions
- openpyxl: used for Microsoft Excel xlsx input/output functionalities

You may get these using conda

```
$ conda install numpy openpyxl
```

or using pip

```
$ pip install numpy openpyxl
```

### Installing

Download the source codes by

```
$ git clone https://github.com/donghun2018/adclick-simulator.git
```

And try running

```
$ python simulator
```

This should generate several .xlsx files in the same directory.
Now you have a running simulator, and you may add your policies by adding a new policy file in Policies/ subdirectory.
